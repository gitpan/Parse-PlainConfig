Parse::PlainConfig
==================

Author: Arthur Corliss
Date:  May 26, 2006

Description:
------------

This is a long overdue complete rewrite.  It has a lot of feature improvements
along with much cleaner and robust coding.

Instructions:
-------------

Like all CPAN modules, just enter the following commands:

	$ perl Makefile.PL
	$ make
	$ make test
	$ make install

If you wish to see sample code using the module, please examine test files in
the t directory.  A sample rc file is there as well, which shows the
robustness of the parser.
