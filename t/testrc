# Scalar tests
SCALAR 1: value1
SCALAR 2: "these, are, all one => value"
SCALAR 3: this is a \
          continued line.
SCALAR 4: ASDFKAS234123098ASDFA9082341\
          ASDFIO23489078907SFASDF8A972
SCALAR 5: this is a really long text that should definitely cause the output \
          generator to wrap lines -- hopefully breaking along whitespace. \
          I should also generation a really freaking long line just to see \
          it break on non-whitespace as well.  Well, how about this: \
          AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\
          BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB\
          CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC\
          DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
